# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies


Unsupervised Machine Learning using Python, pandas, hvplot and scikit learn.


## Overview of Project

In this project we are applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze the cryptocurrency market. For this type of analysis, the preprocessing stage is deeper. We have to clean the data, scaling it and grouping it. 
In this process visualizing the data is very useful, dimension reduction using principal component analysis becomes very handy, to keep the information but being able to plot it using plotly and hvplot.

### Resources used:
-	Data Sources: crypto_data.csv
-	Software: Python, pandas, hvplot and scikit learn.


## Results:

Here is a summary of the results found.



![Scatter plot mined vs supply](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96758511/169592061-566b5edf-1747-4e79-bada-9af62017284a.png)




In this scatter plot we can see that the cryptocurrency market is very young. Most of the cryptocurrencies have low rates of Total Coins Mined and also low rates of Total Coins supply. Time will tell which ones gain more popularity and usage applications to become more attractive investment opportunities.
